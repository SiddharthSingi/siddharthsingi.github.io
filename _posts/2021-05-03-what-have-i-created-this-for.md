title: What have I created this for?
layout: post

The purpose for this blog is straightforward and is similar to many other people like me out there.
* I want to write articles and showcase my work on deep learning, robotics and the use of artificial intelligence in the different fields that I will explore.
*  I dont think I will limit this website to just technical articles but rather use it as an outlet to any thoughts or ideas I have about many varying topics.

I don't necessarily have a fixed direction in which to take this blog.  This is my first attempt to write apart from a decade of boring english assignments. There are many topics that I may want to write about and there are no limitations on me. I think this can be an excellent way to document my thinking and clear my mind. I hope I utilize this medium to its maximum and I do not leave this blog aside or stop writing.
