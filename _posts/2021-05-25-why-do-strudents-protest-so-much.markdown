title: Why do students protest so damn much?

The Tiananmen Square protests in China in 1989, the ongoing Hong Kong protests and the CAA-NRC protests in India have all gathered worldwide attention and have been strong movements against the respective country's governements. They all have one thing in common though, they have all been initiated and led by students. I don't want to talk about who is right and who is wrong over here, but rather bring attention to this peculiar trend of seeing protests led by college students who have barely reached their emotional or physical peaks. Is it just excessive young energy or a lot of free time from classes or is there something else also at play here?

To answer this lets focus a little on the events that transpired in Sri Lanka. In XXXX China invested $XXX billion into Sri Lanka's infrastructure. China loaned this money to Sri Lanka so that it could build roads, rail lines and dams that would boost its economy. The loan amount was __ % of Sri Lankas GDP and as you would expect, Sri Lanka could not pay back the money it took from China. In XXXX Sri Lanka did not have the financials to pay back the loan and fell into this unfortunate debt trap. When China came collecting, Sri Lanka had no choice but to lease a part of its sovereign land in exchange of paying back the loan. China has complete rights over this land and is allowed to build anything it chooses like a military base or even a port for international trade! In the 17th century, many empires would wage wars to conquer new land and expand its country. What we are seeing in Sri Lanka is nothing but the modern day version of the same old conquest.
