I am a masters student studying robotics at Columbia University. I enjoy learning more about robotics and have been working in this field for the last 4 years now. However, as I  specialize further in this field, I have come to realize that I am developing a specific bias in myself. I revere all my professors at Columbia but having said that I feel like a large part of the robotics industry solves problems in a very backward manner. Students and researchers work on some really cool robotics projects like making a robot that can dance or jump (I am doing that myself now) after that they will make the robot do more cool stuff like pick up objects or open a door autonomously. This research work then further grows into complex robotics companies like Boston Dynamics.

Boston Dynamics started out as a research lab on legged robotics at MIT. You must have seen videos of their robots like Spot, the robot dog or Atlas, the humanoid which are amazing feats of engineering. However, I wonder if this is the best way to build a company. BD went from a research idea, to a marvelous piece of engineering and is now searching for problems that its robot can help solve. They are now trying to find use cases for where its robot dog can work in and trying to modify the robot accordingly. Does this not feel like a completely reversed way to build a company?

As an engineer I would love to iterate over a solution to fit in advanced technoliges and better design, but I cannot help but take a step back and think how important is the problem that I am solving in the first place. I dont want to waste my time, pouring my heart out to build something that willl never be used in real life. Which raises the question, how do I formally look for problems in the world that actually matter? This is probably one of the most difficult questions to answer.
